# RequestPing - What It Does & How It Works
## A Non-Technical Overview

## The Problem RequestPing Solves

If you've ever filed FOIA requests in Virginia, you know the pain points:

1. **Your Identity is Public** - When you file a FOIA request from your personal email, the agency knows exactly who you are. This can lead to:
   - **Retaliation or targeting** by officials you're investigating
   - **Tip-offs** - agencies alerting subjects that you're investigating them
   - **Harassment** - being contacted, questioned, or intimidated
   - **Professional consequences** - employers, colleagues, or subjects finding out what you're researching
   - **Pattern recognition** - agencies tracking what you're interested in across multiple requests

2. **Finding the right agency contact** - Every Virginia agency has a different FOIA officer, different email address, and different procedures

3. **Formatting requests properly** - Virginia FOIA law has specific requirements and citing the wrong statute or missing key language can delay responses

4. **Tracking multiple requests** - If you file requests with DMV, State Police, and Health Department, you're juggling three separate email threads with three different timelines

5. **Missing deadlines** - Virginia agencies have 5 working days to respond (extendable to 12), and it's easy to lose track

6. **Fee surprises** - Virginia's 5-hour rule means you need to know when to ask about fees upfront

**RequestPing solves all of this - with privacy protection as the core benefit.**

## What RequestPing Is

Think of RequestPing as your **anonymous FOIA filing service** for Virginia state government.

**The core value: Your identity stays completely private.**

Instead of:
- Filing from your personal email (revealing who you are)
- Looking up which FOIA officer to email
- Drafting a properly formatted request
- Tracking responses in your inbox
- Risking retaliation or targeting
- Agencies knowing what you're investigating

You:
- Log into RequestPing
- Pick a Virginia agency from a dropdown
- Describe what records you want in plain English
- Click submit
- **The agency never knows it's you**
- Track everything in one private dashboard

RequestPing handles the rest: filing in our name, proper formatting, legal citations, submission, and tracking - **all while keeping your identity completely hidden.**

### **1. Getting Started (First Time)**

**What you do:**
- Go to RequestPing website
- Click "Login"
- Enter your email address
- Check your email and click the login link

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- RequestPing sends you a secure, one-time login link (no passwords to remember)

---

### **2. Filing Your First Request**

**What you see:**
A simple form asking:
- **Which Virginia agency?** (dropdown with 20+ agencies: DMV, State Police, Health, etc.)
- **What records do you want?** (describe in plain English)
- **Any specific dates?** (optional)
- **How do you want to receive documents?** (PDF, paper, either)
- **Request a fee waiver?** (if it serves public interest)

**Example request you might write:**
> "I'm requesting all accident reports for Interstate 95 southbound between mile markers 50 and 60, from January 1, 2025 to March 31, 2025. I need these for a traffic safety study I'm conducting."

**What happens when you hit Submit:**

1. **RequestPing checks your monthly limit** (5 requests per month on the basic plan)
2. **Formats your request professionally** with proper Virginia FOIA legal citations
3. **Looks up the correct FOIA officer** for that agency (e.g., DMV's FOIA officer email)
4. **Sends a professional email** on your behalf that includes:
   - Proper legal citation (Va. Code § 2.2-3700 et seq.)
   - Your description of records
   - Date ranges
   - Delivery preference
   - Fee notification request (per Virginia's 5-hour rule)
   - Reminder that Virginia law requires response within 5 working days
   - Professional signature identifying RequestPing as filing on behalf of a Virginia constituent

5. **Saves everything to your dashboard** so you can track it

---

### **3. What the Agency Receives**

The Virginia agency's FOIA officer gets an email that looks like this:

```
To Whom It May Concern:

This is a request under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act
(Va. Code § 2.2-3700 et seq.).

REQUESTED RECORDS:

All accident reports for Interstate 95 southbound between mile
markers 50 and 60, from January 1, 2025 to March 31, 2025.
These records are needed for a traffic safety study.

DATE RANGE:
2025-01-01 to 2025-03-31

DELIVERY FORMAT:
I request that the responsive records be provided in electronic
format (PDF).

FEES:
Please notify me before processing this request if fees will
exceed five hours of staff time, per Virginia FOIA fee guidelines.

Under Virginia FOIA, I understand you have five working days to
respond to this request. Please acknowledge receipt and provide
an estimated timeline for production of the requested records.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

RequestPing
On behalf of a Virginia constituent
records@requestping.com
```

**Why this is better than filing yourself:**
- 🔒 **Your identity is completely protected** - agency never sees your name or email
- 🛡️ **No retaliation risk** - officials can't target you for what you're investigating
- 🎭 **Pattern privacy** - agencies can't track your research interests across multiple requests
- ✅ Proper legal citation (some agencies are sticklers for this)
- ✅ Professional formatting (easier for FOIA officers to process)
- ✅ Clear deadline reminder (agencies are more likely to prioritize properly formatted requests)
- ✅ Fee notification request (prevents surprise bills)
- ✅ Filed from a consistent sender (agencies get to know RequestPing as a legitimate requester)

## What Makes RequestPing Valuable

### **Privacy Protection (The #1 Benefit)**

**Your identity stays completely hidden from agencies.**

When you file through RequestPing:
- Agency sees: "RequestPing, on behalf of a Virginia constituent"
- Agency does NOT see: Your name, your email, your phone, any identifying information
- You remain: Completely anonymous

**Why this matters:**

**For Investigative Journalists:**
- ✅ Investigate corruption without officials knowing it's you
- ✅ Request records about powerful people without tipping them off
- ✅ Protect sources who suggested what to request
- ✅ Avoid being targeted by subjects of your investigation
- ✅ Prevent agencies from connecting the dots across multiple requests

**For Whistleblowers & Insiders:**
- ✅ Request records related to your workplace without revealing yourself
- ✅ Gather evidence of wrongdoing anonymously
- ✅ Avoid employer retaliation for FOIA requests
- ✅ Protect your career while exposing problems

**For Activists & Advocates:**
- ✅ Request records about controversial issues without personal harassment
- ✅ Avoid being put on "watch lists" by agencies you're criticizing
- ✅ Protect yourself from officials who don't like scrutiny
- ✅ Keep your organizing strategy private

**For Private Citizens:**
- ✅ Request records about neighbors, landlords, or local issues without them knowing it was you
- ✅ Investigate problems without becoming a target
- ✅ Keep your personal life private while exercising FOIA rights
- ✅ Avoid awkward confrontations or social consequences

**For Researchers:**
- ✅ Request sensitive data without revealing research hypotheses
- ✅ Avoid agencies giving you "helpful" filtered data when they know what you're studying
- ✅ Protect competitive research advantage
- ✅ Get unbiased records before agencies know what you're looking for

### **Plus All the Practical Benefits:**

1. **Saves time** - No more looking up FOIA contacts for each agency
2. **Professional formatting** - Increases response rate and speed
3. **Centralized tracking** - All requests in one place, not scattered across email
4. **Deadline awareness** - Never miss a 5-day response window
5. **Proper legal citations** - Ensures compliance and reduces rejections

## Current Capabilities (As of December 2025)

### ✅ **What Works Now:**

1. **20 Virginia State Agencies** - Pre-configured with correct FOIA contacts
   - Department of Motor Vehicles
   - Virginia State Police
   - Department of Health
   - Department of Education
   - Department of Corrections
   - Department of Environmental Quality
   - And 14 more...

2. **Automatic Email Submission** - For agencies with email contacts
3. **Dashboard Tracking** - See all your requests and their statuses
4. **Virginia FOIA Compliance** - Proper legal citations and formatting
5. **Monthly Request Limits** - 5 requests per month per user (adjustable)
6. **Secure Login** - Magic link authentication (no passwords)

### 🔄 **What's Manual (For Now):**

1. **Agency Responses** - Agencies reply to you directly via email (you forward documents to yourself)
2. **Status Updates** - You manually update request status when agencies respond
3. **Portal-Based Agencies** - Some agencies use NextRequest portals (VDH, VDOE, VSP) - RequestPing logs these but doesn't auto-submit yet

---

## Behind the Scenes: What RequestPing Actually Does

Think of RequestPing as having three main jobs:

### **Job 1: Knowledge Database**
- Maintains up-to-date contact information for Virginia FOIA officers
- Knows which agencies accept email vs. require web portals
- Stores proper legal citations and formatting requirements
- Tracks agency-specific quirks and requirements

### **Job 2: Request Factory**
- Takes your plain-English description
- Wraps it in proper Virginia FOIA legal language
- Adds all required elements (citations, fee notices, deadlines)
- Routes to correct FOIA officer automatically
- Sends professional email on your behalf

### **Job 3: Filing Cabinet**
- Stores all your requests in a searchable database
- Tracks submission dates and deadlines
- Organizes documents you receive
- Creates audit trail of all activity
- Provides dashboard view of everything

---

## The Virginia-Specific Advantage

Unlike generic FOIA tools that try to handle all 50 states plus federal, RequestPing **specializes in Virginia**. This means:

1. **Accurate Agency Database** - We maintain Virginia-specific contacts, not a generic national list
2. **Virginia Law Citations** - Uses Va. Code § 2.2-3700 (not federal 5 USC § 552)
3. **5-Day Timeline** - Tracks Virginia's specific response requirements, not federal 20-day
4. **5-Hour Fee Rule** - Knows Virginia's unique fee structure
5. **Virginia Residency** - Filed by a Virginia resident (me, Jonny) on your behalf - legally compliant with Virginia's residency requirement

---

## Real-World Example: Filing a DMV Request

**Traditional way (without RequestPing):**

1. Google "Virginia DMV FOIA contact" → find website
2. Navigate through DMV site to find FOIA page
3. Find FOIA officer email: foia@dmv.virginia.gov
4. Open email client
5. Draft request - hope you cite the right statute
6. Send email from your personal account
7. Wait 5 days, hopefully remember to follow up
8. Agency responds to your personal email
9. Download documents, file them somewhere
10. Repeat for next agency (State Police, Health, etc.)

**With RequestPing:**

1. Log into RequestPing
2. Click "New Request"
3. Select "Department of Motor Vehicles" from dropdown
4. Type what you want: "Accident reports for I-95, mile markers 50-60, Jan-Mar 2025"
5. Click Submit
6. Check dashboard for status
7. All requests (DMV, Police, Health) tracked in one place

**Time saved:** ~15 minutes per request
**Error reduction:** ~90% (no more wrong email addresses, missing citations, etc.)
**Mental overhead:** Gone (no tracking spreadsheets needed)

## Future Possibilities (Ideas for Development)

Your dad might want to help build some of these:

### **Immediate Wins:**
1. **Email Inbox Integration** - RequestPing receives agency responses automatically, updates status
2. **Portal Auto-Submit** - Integrate with NextRequest portals to auto-file for portal-only agencies
3. **Template Library** - Pre-written templates for common requests (police reports, health inspections, etc.)
4. **Bulk Filing** - Submit same request to multiple agencies at once

### **Medium-Term:**
1. **Document Storage** - Store received PDFs in RequestPing (not just tracking)
2. **Agency Response Analytics** - Track which agencies respond fastest, which charge fees most often
3. **Follow-up Automation** - Auto-send reminder emails at day 5, day 12, etc.
4. **Multi-State Expansion** - Add Maryland, DC, North Carolina

### **Long-Term:**
1. **Public Request Database** - Searchable archive of successful requests (helps everyone)
2. **AI-Powered Suggestions** - "People who requested X from DMV also requested Y from State Police"
3. **Collaborative Features** - Share request templates with colleagues
4. **Appeal Automation** - Draft appeals for denied requests
5. **FOIA Response Quality Scoring** - Rate agencies on speed, completeness, fees

---

## Who This Helps Most

**Perfect for:**
- ✅ Journalists covering Virginia state government
- ✅ Researchers studying Virginia policy/data
- ✅ Advocates working on Virginia issues (housing, environment, criminal justice)
- ✅ Lawyers who file regular FOIA requests for cases
- ✅ Individuals who need state records (DMV, health, education)
- ✅ Anyone filing 3+ requests per year (ROI on time saved)

**Less useful for:**
- ❌ One-time requesters (overhead might not be worth it)
- ❌ People needing federal records (this is Virginia-only now)
- ❌ County/city FOIA (this is state agencies only)

---

## Current Limitations (Good to Know)

1. **Virginia State Only** - No federal, no local/county government
2. **20 Agencies** - Not every Virginia agency yet (but growing)
3. **Email Verification** - Some agency contacts still need verification
4. **Manual Response Handling** - You still receive agency emails directly
5. **No Document Storage** - Documents live in your email, not RequestPing (yet)
6. **Portal Agencies** - NextRequest-based agencies noted but not auto-submitted
7. **Invite-Only** - Currently limited to jk@litten.org and jj@litten.org

---

## The Bottom Line

**RequestPing is a productivity tool for Virginia FOIA requesters.**

It doesn't change what you can request (that's determined by Virginia law). It doesn't magically make agencies respond faster (that's up to them).

**What it does:**
- Makes filing faster (3 minutes vs. 15 minutes)
- Makes requests more professional (better formatting, proper citations)
- Makes tracking easier (dashboard vs. email chaos)
- Makes you more productive (file more requests in less time)

**It's especially valuable if you:**
- File requests regularly (3+ per year)
- Request from multiple agencies
- Need to track multiple requests simultaneously
- Want to maintain professional relationships with FOIA officers
- Value your time

## Questions Your Dad Might Have

**Q: Why would agencies respond better to RequestPing than to me directly?**

A: They don't necessarily respond *faster*, but they're more likely to process requests correctly the first time because:
- Professional formatting reduces confusion
- Proper citations show you know the law
- Consistent sender (RequestPing) builds familiarity
- Clear fee language prevents misunderstandings

**Q: Can agencies tell it's not me filing directly?**

A: Yes, the email clearly states "RequestPing on behalf of a Virginia constituent." But they have **no idea who the actual person is**. This is:
- ✅ 100% legally compliant with Virginia FOIA
- ✅ Honest and transparent about using a filing service
- ✅ Actually preferred by some FOIA officers (professional filers get better treatment)
- ✅ Common practice (lawyers, journalists, and researchers often file on behalf of others)

The agency knows someone is requesting records, but they have zero information about your identity.

**Q: What happens to my personal information?**

A: Your email is stored securely and never shared. Agencies only see RequestPing's email address, not yours. You can choose to include your contact info in the request description if needed.

**Q: What if an agency calls or emails me directly?**

A: They won't have your direct contact unless you include it. They'll respond to RequestPing's email address. (Future enhancement: RequestPing forwards responses to you automatically.)

**Q: How do I get my documents?**

A: Currently, you update RequestPing to note "completed" and manage documents yourself. Future versions will auto-capture documents from agency responses.

**Q: What about appeals if denied?**

A: Not automated yet, but on the roadmap. For now, you'd handle appeals yourself using Virginia's FOIA appeal process.

**Q: Does this cost money?**

A: Not yet launched publicly. Current users (jk@ and jj@) are free beta testers.
