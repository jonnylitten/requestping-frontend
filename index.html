            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is anonymous FOIA filing legal?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Virginia FOIA law (Va. Code § 2.2-3700 et seq.) requires requests to be made by Virginia residents, but doesn't require the requester to be the end user. We're a Virginia resident filing on your behalf - completely legal and transparent. The agency knows it's RequestPing, but has no idea who you are.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How anonymous am I really?</h3>
                <p>Completely anonymous from everyone. Anyone looking at public FOIA records will only see "RequestPing, on behalf of a Virginia constituent" - no name, no email, no identifying information. Your identity is protected from agencies, the public, and anyone else who might search FOIA logs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why Virginia only?</h3>
                <p>Virginia FOIA law requires requests to be filed by Virginia residents. Since we're based in Virginia, we can legally file on your behalf. This residency requirement actually enhances privacy - we're not a national platform where patterns could be tracked.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can you help with appeals?</h3>
                <p>We can provide general information about the appeals process, but custom appeal assistance may constitute legal advice. For complex appeals, we recommend consulting a FOIA attorney.</p>
